# well_being_app

The goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a notes and reminder app for users. The user can create notes that they want themselves to see after conditions that they themselves set are met, such as after they spend a certain amount of time on their phone or after they open a certain app. The user can also create reminders for themselves that pop up as notifications on the date and at the time that the user desires. 

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated skills in developing a cross-platform mobile app with Flutter.
